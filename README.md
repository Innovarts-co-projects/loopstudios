## My process

This is a very simple site! In *CSS* I used *Flex Box* in almost everything and added a little *Grid* to diversify, I tried to make *HTML* as semantic as possible to make the structure easier to read and *Javascript* is just a function that add a *class* to make the mobile menu open.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I loved developing this website because it gave me a feeling of really working on a real project for a company, and it made me see certain gaps in my knowledge and I intend to get more of my knowledge about *Grid* and *Flex Box* to be able to build websites in the best possible way!
